# MSAP: A method of multidimensional software aging prediction based on ensemble learning: a case of Android OS


We propose a method of multidimensional software aging prediction based on ensemble learning called MSAP. Unlike the previous full-process single-threaded approaches, in the framework of MSAP, five dimensions including datasets, labeling metrics, labeling thresholds, algorithms, and model decisions are extracted and diversified to protest against diverse user scenarios and aging situations.

When subjected to identical workloads, MSAP demonstrates comparable performance to the majority of unidimensional models, albeit without significant prominence. Under different workloads, MSAP consistently outperforms unidimensional models whose performance drops dramatically in terms of precision, maintaining a notable lead while exhibiting minimal fluctuations.
